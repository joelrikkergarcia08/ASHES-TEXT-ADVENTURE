This repo has the contents of a short text adventure game written in python. 
I am not the most experienced programmer as i am in my first year of high school but i do enjoy it and this has been my first fairly longer project. 
Hopefully, you'll enjoy the game and if you do, please send me an email at joelrikkergarcia@gmail.com if you want to suggest anything.
THANK YOU!!!
